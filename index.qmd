  SAM-Guide’s **high level** objective is to efficiently **assist Visually Impaired People (VIP)** in tasks that require **interactions with space**. It aims to develop a **multimodal interface** to assist VIP during different types of spatial interactions, including *object reaching*, *large-scale navigation* (indoor and outdoor), and outdoor *sport activities*. 
  
  SAM-Guide aims to **study and model how to optimally supplement vision with both auditory and tactile feedback**, reframing spatial interactions as target-reaching affordances, and symbolizing spatial properties by 3D ego-centered beacons. Candidate encoding schemes will be evaluated through *Augmented Reality (AR)* serious games relying on motion capture platforms and indoor localisation solutions to track the user’s movements.

  SAM-Guide is a inter-disciplinary collaboration project between three sites: (1) the [LPNC](/content/consortium/LPNC/) and [GIPSA](/content/consortium/GIPSA/) laboratories from the Grenoble-Alpes University, (2) the [CMAP](/content/consortium/CMAP/) from Ecole Polytechnique in Paris-Saclay, and the [LITIS](/content/consortium/LITIS/) and [CERREV](/content/consortium/CERREV/) from Normandy University.
